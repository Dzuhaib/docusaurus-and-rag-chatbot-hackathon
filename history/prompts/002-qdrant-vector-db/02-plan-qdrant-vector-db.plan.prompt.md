## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

I have all the necessary context. Now, I will create the content for the `plan.md` file.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed implementation plan (`plan.md`) and associated design documents (`research.md`, `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`) for the Qdrant vector database integration feature.
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: 4 created: `specs/002-qdrant-vector-db/plan.md`, `specs/002-qdrant-vector-db/research.md`, `specs/002-qdrant-vector-db/data-model.md`, `specs/002-qdrant-vector-db/quickstart.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with the `/sp.tasks` command to generate the task list for implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning phase was successful, outlining the technical details and project structure for the Qdrant integration.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
