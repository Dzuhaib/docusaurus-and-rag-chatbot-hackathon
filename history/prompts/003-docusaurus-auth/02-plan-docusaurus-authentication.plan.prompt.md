## Prompt

/sp.plan

## Response snapshot

I have all the necessary context. Now, I will create the content for the `plan.md` file.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created a detailed implementation plan (`plan.md`) and associated design documents (`research.md`, `data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`) for the Docusaurus authentication feature.
- 🧪 Tests: None
- 📁 Files: 4 created: `specs/003-docusaurus-auth/plan.md`, `specs/003-docusaurus-auth/research.md`, `specs/003-docusaurus-auth/data-model.md`, `specs/003-docusaurus-auth/quickstart.md`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with the `/sp.tasks` command to generate the task list for implementation.
- 🧠 Reflection: The planning phase was successful, outlining the technical details and project structure for Netlify Identity integration.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
