# Introduction to Physical AI

The book, "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics," focuses on bridging the gap between digital AI and physical embodiment. It provides a roadmap for designing, simulating, and deploying intelligent humanoid robots that can perceive and interact with the physical world. The curriculum covers foundational robot control using ROS 2, creating realistic simulations with Gazebo and Unity, and implementing advanced AI for perception and navigation with NVIDIA Isaac. A key theme is the integration of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, enabling robots to understand and execute natural language commands, culminating in a capstone project to build a truly autonomous humanoid.
